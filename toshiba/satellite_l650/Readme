 Toshiba Satellite L650 comes installed with Windows. When Linux is installed on 
 this it lacks some basic ACPI functionality like battery status, brightness 
 control etc. By adding this custom DSDT table you can get back those lost 
 functionality. You can make you kernel use this custom DSDT by two methods.

1) Configure GRUB to provide this custom DSDT table to kernel -> Works with all 
installed kernel versions

2) Compile a custom kernel with this DSDT -> works only for that specific kernel

Steps
=====

1) Install 'iasl' package.

2) Compile this DSDT.dsl using below command

    iasl -tc DSDT.dsl

This will generate DSDT.hex

3) Use this hex file to specify a custom ACPI table in GRUB config or build a 
custom kernel using this file.
